                        <h3>Here's a time line of Paul Walker's Life :</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Walker was raised in a Latter-day Saint household, but later became a non-denominational
                                Christian.[25] He lived in Santa Barbara with his dogs.[6][26] He and Rebecca Soteros, a
                                one-time girlfriend, had a daughter named Meadow Rain Walker,[27] who lived with her
                                mother in Hawaii for 13 years and then moved to California to live with Walker in
                                2011.[28] Her godfather is Vin Diesel, with whom Walker shared a close bond; Diesel gave
                                him the nickname "Pablo",[29] while Walker's mother referred to her son as Diesel's
                                "other half".[30] Walker was also close friends with fellow Fast & Furious co-star
                                Tyrese Gibson.[31][32] At the time of his death, Walker was in a relationship with
                                Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell.[33][34][35]</li>
                            <li>Walker began a modelling career as a toddler, starring in a television commercial for
                                Pampers at age two. He continued to appear in commercials, most notably for Showbiz
                                Pizza in 1984,[11] before beginning an acting career on television that year, appearing
                                in the teen anthology series CBS Schoolbreak Special. Walker continued to work in
                                television until 1996, across a number of genres; he appeared in two episodes of the
                                fantasy drama Highway to Heaven between 1984 and 1986, and secured his first leading
                                role in 1987, appearing as Jeremy Beatty in the sitcom Throb. He continued to feature on
                                sitcoms in the early 1990s, with guest roles in Charles in Charge, Who's the Boss?, and
                                the short-lived What a Dummy. In 1993, he portrayed Brandon Collins on the soap opera
                                The Young and the Restless; he and co-star Heather Tom, who played Victoria Newman,
                                gained fame, and were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Actress in a Soap Opera
                                at the Youth in Film Awards. Walker's final television role was on Touched by an Angel,
                                although he appeared as himself, alongside his sister Ashlie, as contestants on a 1988
                                episode of the game show I'm Telling!, in which they finished in second place.</li>
                            <li>Walker began his film career in 1986, appearing mainly in low budget B films. His first
                                role was in the horror comedy Monster in the Closet, and a year later, starred in The
                                Retaliator (retroactively subtitled Programmed to Kill), a science fiction film. In
                                1994, he returned to film, starring in Tammy and the T-Rex, but secured his first
                                feature film role in the comedy Meet the Deedles in 1998; although commercially and
                                critically unsuccessful, it allowed Walker to secure supporting roles in the films
                                Pleasantville (1998), Varsity Blues (1999), She's All That (1999), and The Skulls
                                (2000).[citation needed]</li>
                            <li>In 2001, Walker's breakthrough role was starring opposite Vin Diesel in the action film
                                The Fast and the Furious; it was commercially successful, and subsequently launched a
                                media franchise. The film also established Walker as a film star and leading man, as his
                                performance garnered the MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Team (shared with Diesel) in
                                2002. Walker starred in the critically successful thriller Joy Ride (2001), also
                                focusing on car-related action, and reprised his role as Brian O'Conner in the 2003
                                sequel 2 Fast 2 Furious. After this, he starred either in low-budget or commercially
                                unsuccessful films for a time, notably Timeline (2003) and Into the Blue (2005).</li>
                            <li>Walker portrayed Hank Hansen in Clint Eastwood's war film Flags of Our Fathers (2006)
                                and starred in the survival drama Eight Below, both released in 2006. Eight Below
                                garnered critical acclaim and opened in first place at the box office, grossing over
                                US$20 million during its opening weekend.[13] Walker then starred in the independent
                                film The Lazarus Project, which was released on DVD on October 21, 2008.</li>
                            <li>A car enthusiast, Walker competed in the Redline Time Attack racing series in which he
                                raced on the AE Performance Team driving a BMW E92 M3. His car was sponsored by Etnies,
                                Brembo Brakes, Ã–hlins, Volk, OS Giken, Hankook, Gintani, and Reach Out Worldwide.[45]
                                Walker had been preparing for an auto show prior to his death.[46] Walker owned Always
                                Evolving, a Valencia high-end vehicle performance shop, where Rodas, a pro-am
                                racer,[47][48] acted as CEO.[49]</li>
                            <li>Walker also had a large car collection of about 30 cars, a portion of which he co-owned
                                along with Rodas.[50] In January 2020, twenty-one vehicles owned by Walker were sold for
                                a combined $2.33 million during spirited bidding at an annual car auction in
                                Arizona.[51]</li>
